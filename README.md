# Card animations, wave animations, viewcontroller transition animations
Develop transition between viewcontrollers and their transitions,such as show up and boucing a view, zoom in for card and translate into a viewcontroller, wave animation and moving, displaying views animation, Data loaded is queried from Firebase Firestore 

Card Animation technique : 

1/ place image in scollview, display image with 20px spacing between cell size and image after cropped size for all direction

2/ when animating increase scrollview size upto 40px on the size RIGHT and BOTTOM, 

3/ to achieve animation on the TOP and LEFT scrollview will be move UP and LEFT at the same time of animation

4/ Add bouncing and corder radius animation

# Reading and parsing html from google translate to display definition of words
Using xpath to parse html from a website to get element needed for a words such as definition, example, synonym and word type (noun, verb or adjective)

# Loadings animation and add more post from  firebase

I developed from scratch an animation such as shaking, curving and bouncing a line and finally to project the space ships, data is stored and loaded with order from firebase (url of a post will be parsed to get OG data in order to obtain the picture title....) 

height of each cell is flexible and depend upon the size of the image loaded from the website url will provide different image)

Height cell will be calculated based on 4 factors :  screen-size-width, screen-size-height and image-size-width, image-size-height. After height has been calculated the cell will be added to collectionview
